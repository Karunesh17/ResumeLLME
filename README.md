👉 Check some sample résumés generated by ResuLLMe ([1](./.github/samples/Simple.pdf), [2](./.github/samples/Alta.pdf), [3](./.github/samples/Awesome.pdf))

## 🚀 Concept

ResuLLMe is a prototype that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to tailor résumés. It's goal is to enhance résumés to help candidates avoid common mistakes that occur while applying for jobs. It is like a smart career advisor to check your résumé.

You can use ResuLLMe live at [https://resullme.streamlit.app/](https://resullme.streamlit.app/).

## 🛠 How It Works
ResuLLMe now supports both OpenAI and Gemini, empowering the application to enhance résumés with even more powerful and diverse language models, providing users with smarter, more accurate career guidance.  

ResuLLMe receives your previous CV as a PDF or Word Document. Then, it uses LLMs to:
* Improve the résumé following published résumé guidelines by well-reputed schools
* Convert the résumés to a JSON Resume format
* Render the JSON resume using LaTeX to generate a new PDF of the enhanced resume

## 🏃 Running

To run ResuLLMe locally, the simplest way is to use Docker:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will make the app avaialable at [`https://localhost:8501/`](https://localhost:8501/)

### 🪄 Installation Instructions for Running Natively

To run the app without Docker, you will need to install two things for the app to work. The first item is to install the Python dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The second item is to install the LaTeX packages:

```
xargs sudo apt install -y < packages.txt
```

Lastly, to run ResuLLMe locally, execute:

```
streamlit run src/Main.py
```
